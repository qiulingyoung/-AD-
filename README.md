AI - Driven Multimodal Framework: Advancing Alzheimer's Early Detection, Subtyping, and Understanding

Tremendous advancements in neuroimaging, genomics, and biomarker technologies have enabled us to capture various characteristics of brain diseases in living patients. Collecting multimodal data from large patient databases allows for a comprehensive understanding of brain lesions, biological processes, genetic risk factors, and symptoms.
The aim of this study is to construct Alzheimer's disease models for multimodal patients based on appropriate data-driven approaches. To this end, new data representation and statistical learning methods are developed, which can integrate multiple types of data: neuroimaging, peripheral biomarkers, clinical, and omics data (genetics, transcriptomics). Specifically, some methods are developed to highlight the interaction networks among multiple data sources, track the changes in data during the disease progression, and automatically predict the current or future clinical outcomes based on this data. These models are applied to Alzheimer's disease. These models will deepen the understanding of nervous system diseases and facilitate the development of novel decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical trial design.
